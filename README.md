FirmwareGuard is a **low-level, vendor-independent framework** for detecting and analyzing firmware-level telemetry on x86/x64 systems. It provides deep visibility into chipset telemetry mechanisms like Intel ME, AMD PSP, ACPI tables, and NIC firmware capabilities.

Built for **security researchers, hardware engineers, and privacy-focused operators** who need transparent, auditable firmware security.

---

## 🔥 Why FirmwareGuard Matters

Firmware-level telemetry bypasses traditional OS-level privacy controls:
- **Intel ME** can access network interfaces independent of the OS
- **AMD PSP** controls boot security and attestation
- **ACPI firmware** collects performance metrics
- **NIC firmware** enables remote management (AMT, DASH)

Traditional security tools operate at the OS level and **cannot detect or control firmware telemetry**.

FirmwareGuard fills this gap.

---

## 🔒 Privacy-First: 100% Offline-Only

**FirmwareGuard operates with ZERO network dependencies.**

### Why Offline-Only?
- **Your firmware data never leaves your machine** - No cloud, no telemetry, no "phoning home"
- **Perfect for air-gapped systems** - Works on completely isolated networks (government, military, research)
- **No trust required** - We can't collect your data if we never connect
- **Verifiable privacy** - 100% open source, auditable code, zero network syscalls

### What This Means:
- ✅ All operations are local-only
- ✅ All reports stored on your filesystem
- ✅ No update servers or cloud dependencies
- ✅ No usage analytics or crash reporting
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ❌ No central management server (see [FirmwareGuard Enterprise](#enterprise-version) for fleet features)
- ❌ No network communication of any kind
- ❌ No HTTP, TCP, UDP, or any network protocols

**Enforcement:**
- Makefile checks block networking code at build time
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental network code
- CI/CD validates offline-only architecture

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

### ✅ Hardware Probe & Audit
- **CPU & Chipset Analysis**: Detects Intel ME, AMD PSP, and associated firmware versions.
- **ACPI Table Parsing**: Analyzes tables like FPDT, TPM2, DMAR, and IVRS for telemetry indicators.
- **NIC Firmware Capabilities**: Identifies Wake-on-LAN, Intel AMT, and remote stats reporting.
- **Risk Assessment**: Classifies system risk (LOW to CRITICAL) based on detected components.
- **Audit Reports**: Generates JSON and human-readable reports with actionable recommendations.

### ✅ Active Hardening & Blocking
- **Intel ME Control**: Disables ME via HAP bit manipulation in UEFI variables, with analysis and validation.
- **AMD PSP Mitigation**: Neutralizes PSP activity by injecting kernel parameters through GRUB configuration.
- **Persistent Blocking**: Enforces configurations at boot time using a systemd service.
- **Enhanced NIC Control**: Persistently disables Wake-on-LAN and mitigates Intel AMT/vPro.

### ✅ Safety & Reliability
- **Security Hardened**: Built with stack protection, PIE, RELRO, and `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` to prevent exploitation.
- **Safety Framework**: Includes a dry-run mode, automatic backups with checksums, and rollback points for safe testing.
- **User Confirmation**: Requires explicit user approval for critical, potentially destructive operations.
- **Failsafe Rollback**: Integrates with the bootloader to revert changes in case of boot failure.

### ✅ Extensible Architecture
- **Kernel Module (Optional)**: Provides a mechanism for kernel-level MMIO region tracking and DMA restriction.
- **Configuration System**: Manages settings and state via a clear configuration file (`/etc/firmwareguard/config.conf`).

### ✅ Enhanced Security & CI/CD (Phase 3 - NEW!)
- **Lightweight Agent**: CLI-based daemon for scheduled scanning and offline audit caching.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated hardware validation and compliance checking.
- **Secure Boot Detection**: Pre-flight checks prevent UEFI modification failures on Secure Boot systems.
- **HAP Platform Validation**: CPU generation detection prevents Intel ME disable attempts on unsupported hardware.
- **HAP Platform Validation**: CPU generation detection prevents system bricking on unsupported platforms.
- **Enhanced GRUB Safety**: Comprehensive dry-run validation and timestamped backups.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Linux kernel** with MSR support (CONFIG_X86_MSR)
- **GCC** or compatible C compiler
- **Root privileges** for hardware access
- **ethtool** (optional, for NIC control)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KKingZero/FirmwareGuard.git
cd FirmwareGuard

# Build userspace binary (with security hardening)
make

# Build kernel module (optional - for MMIO/DMA protection)
make kernel

# Test
./firmwareguard --help

# Install system-wide (optional)
sudo make install

# Install systemd service (optional - for boot-time enforcement)
sudo cp systemd/firmwareguard.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

**Note**: Phase 2 build includes security hardening flags:
- Stack protection (`-fstack-protector-strong`)
- Buffer overflow detection (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`)
- Position independent executable (`-fPIE -pie`)
- Full RELRO (`-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`)
- Non-executable stack (`-Wl,-z,noexecstack`)

### Kernel Module Requirements

FirmwareGuard requires the `msr` kernel module for CPU register access:

```bash
# Load MSR module
sudo modprobe msr

# Verify
ls /dev/cpu/0/msr
```

To load automatically on boot, add `msr` to `/etc/modules`.

## 🔬 Technical Details

### What FirmwareGuard Detects

#### Intel Management Engine (ME)
- **Detection Method:** PCI configuration space scan (bus 0, device 22, function 0)
- **Capability Analysis:** MMIO register reads from MEI base address
- **Version Extraction:** sysfs `/sys/kernel/debug/mei/mei0/devstate`
- **AMT Detection:** Heuristic based on ME device ID ranges

#### AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP)
- **Detection Method:** CPUID leaf 0x8000001F (SEV capability)
- **Version:** AMD microcode patch level MSR
- **Secure Boot:** CPUID 0x80000001 ECX bit 2

#### ACPI Tables
- **Source:** `/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/`
- **Analyzed Tables:**
  - **FPDT:** Firmware Performance Data (boot metrics)
  - **TPM2:** Trusted Platform Module 2.0
  - **DMAR:** Intel VT-d (DMA remapping)
  - **IVRS:** AMD IOMMU
  - **Custom OEM tables**

#### Network Interfaces
- **Detection:** sysfs `/sys/class/net/` enumeration
- **PCI IDs:** Vendor/device ID extraction
- **Driver Info:** ethtool GDRVINFO ioctl
- **Capabilities:**
  - Wake-on-LAN (sysfs power/wakeup)
  - Intel AMT (device ID heuristics)
  - Statistics reporting (driver presence)

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

Risk scores are calculated based on:
- **Intel ME active + AMT:** +5 points → HIGH/CRITICAL
- **AMD PSP active:** +2 points → MEDIUM
- **TPM present:** +2 points → MEDIUM
- **NIC with remote mgmt:** +3 points → HIGH
- **FPDT table:** +1 point → LOW

**Risk Levels:**
- CRITICAL: ≥8 points
- HIGH: 5-7 points
- MEDIUM: 3-4 points
- LOW: 1-2 points
- NONE: 0 points

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Permissions Required

FirmwareGuard requires **root** for:
- `/dev/mem` access (MMIO reads)
- `/dev/cpu/*/msr` access (MSR reads)
- `/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/` (ACPI parsing)
- PCI configuration space (I/O ports 0xCF8/0xCFC)

### Safety Guarantees

FirmwareGuard now incorporates a comprehensive **safety framework** to protect against system instability and bricking:
- ✅ **Automatic Backup & Restore**: Critical modifications are preceded by backups with checksums.
- ✅ **Dry-Run Mode**: All destructive operations can be simulated without making actual changes.
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Changes can be reverted to previous states using defined rollback points.
- ✅ **User Confirmation**: Explicit user approval is required for all critical and potentially destructive actions.
- ✅ **Failsafe Mechanisms**: Integration with GRUB for boot failure recovery and automatic reapplication prevention.

### Future Phases

- **Phase 3:** Enterprise & Fleet Management, advanced detection (see ROADMAP.md for details)
- **Phase 4:** Research & Innovation

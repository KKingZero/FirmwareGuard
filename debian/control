Description: Firmware integrity and anomaly detection framework
 FirmwareGuard is an open-source framework for detecting and analyzing
 firmware-level telemetry on x86/x64 systems. It provides deep visibility
 into chipset telemetry mechanisms like Intel ME, AMD PSP, ACPI tables,
 and NIC firmware capabilities.
 .
 Key features:
  * Hardware probe and audit (Intel ME, AMD PSP, ACPI, NIC)
  * Active hardening and blocking capabilities
  * Pattern-based telemetry detection
  * Offline-only operation (100% privacy-first)
  * JSON and text report generation
  *

 Optional kernel module for advanced MMIO/DMA protection
 .
 Built for security researchers, hardware engineers, and privacy-focused
 operators who need transparent, auditable firmware security.

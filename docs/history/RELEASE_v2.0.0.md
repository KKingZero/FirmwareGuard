# FirmwareGuard v2.0.0 - Phase 4 Draft Notes

**Status: draft/unreleased**

These notes describe Phase 4 goals and source modules present in the tree. They
should not be treated as a shipped release until the modules are wired into the
default CLI, covered by CI, and a release is explicitly cut.

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

FirmwareGuard operates **100% offline** - no network connectivity, no telemetry, no external dependencies at runtime. All threat intelligence and CVE data is bundled locally.

## ✨ New Features

### 🔬 Ghidra Integration Suite
- Python scripts for automated UEFI driver analysis
- Intel ME firmware reverse engineering support
- C wrapper for headless Ghidra batch processing
- Suspicious code pattern detection

### 📦 Supply Chain Verification
- SQLite database for trusted firmware checksums
- JSON import/export for offline hash updates
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 verification

### 🛡️ Firmware Rootkit Detection
Signature-based detection for known firmware threats:
| Family | Type | Severity |
|--------|------|----------|
| LoJax | UEFI Rootkit | Critical |
| MosaicRegressor | UEFI Bootkit | Critical |
| MoonBounce | SPI Implant | Critical |
| CosmicStrand | UEFI Rootkit | Critical |
| BlackLotus | UEFI Bootkit | Critical |
| ESPecter | ESP Bootkit | High |

Plus behavioral and heuristic analysis with MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

### 💾 Live Firmware Memory Dump

- Coverage: Intel ME, AMD PSP, UEFI vulnerabilities
- CVSS scoring and severity ratings
- Offline searchable database

### 🎯 Threat Intelligence
- Local IOC database with 8 malware families
- 32 indicators of compromise (hashes, patterns)
- File hash matching against known threats
